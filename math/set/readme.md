1. Sets and functions between sets are a modeling language for mathematics.
2. Bijections show up everywhere, and theyâ€™re a central tool for understanding the
same object from two different perspectives.
3. Mathematicians usually accept silent type conversions between sets when it makes
sense to do so, i.e., when there is a very clear and natural bijection between the two sets.
4. Induction is a similar idea to recursion in programming, but applied to proofs.
5. A picture or example that captures the spirit of a fully general proof is often good
enough
