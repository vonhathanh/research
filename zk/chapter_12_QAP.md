- A QAP is a system of equations where the coefficients are monovariate polynomials and a valid solution results in a single polynomial equality. 
- They are quadratic because they have only one polynomial multiplication
- A program can be represented as an R1CS, but evaluating it is not succinct due to the many operations of matrix multiplication.
- Due to the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma â€“ in a sense, we can compress a polynomial down to a single point
- Key ideas behind QAP:
    - Operations in R1CS form an ring when viewed as a set of vectors
    - Polynomials under addition and multiplication are rings
    - There exists an easily computable homomorphism from R1CS to polynomials
    - Instead of evaluating polynomials by coefficients, we can evaluate them at a random point
- Lets say we have a transformation poly and a random value t. We do the following:
    - u = poly(Ls)(t)
    - v = poly(Rs)(t)
    - w = poly(Os)(t)
- if u*v = w, then the two polynomias are the same, as well as Ls*Rs = Os
- We then turn u, v, w to EC points to hide their value, verifier just need to pairing(A, B) and compare with pairing(C, G12)
- The goal is prove Ls*Rs = Os using only 3 values
- We have:
    - Vectors under addition and hadamard product are rings
    - Polynomials under addition and multiplition are rings
- Theorem: there exists a Ring homomorphism from column vectors of dimension n with real number elements to polynomial
with real coefficients
- Polynomial as a set: instead of thinking of a polynomial as: y = 2x^3 + x^2 -5, we could think of polynomial as a set of infinite pairs (x, y) where (x, y) satisfies the polynomial equation.
- In this definition, we don't have degree or coefficients, just a bag of pairs
- We could add two polynomials as a set using cartesian product
- Computing the transformation function for the homomorphism
    - To make a polynomial convey the same infomation as a vector, we decide on n predetermined values of x whose y values will represent the elements of the vector
    - Theorem: given n points (x, y) on a cartesian plane, they can be uniquely interpolated by a polynomial of degree n-1. If the degree is not constrainted, then there are infinite number of polynomials of degree n-1 or higher can do that
    - If we are encoding n-dimension vectors as polys, we need n predetermined points. Let's say n = 3, we will pick
    x = 1, x = 2, x = 3 (this is arbitrary, we could pick 4, 5, 6...). If we are trying to encode 4, 6, 9 then the polynomial must travel through these points: (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6).
