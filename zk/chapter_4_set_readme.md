- A set is a well-defined collection of objects and each object is unique
- Sets are allowed to be empty
- Exercise 1: Set of rational numbers: {a/b: a, b in Z and b # 0)
- Exercise 2: Integers are subset of rational numbers, rational numbers are subset of real numbers, real numbers are subset of complex numbers
- Exercise 3: Transcendental numbers are subset of complex numbers
- Sets are considered equal if they contain the same elements, regardless of order
- Cardinality: sets can have finite or unfinite number of elements. There are different levels of infinite in set theory.
For example, there are infinitely many more real numbers than there are integers. We say integers are countably infinite and
real numbers are uncountably infinitive
- Exercise 4: If two finite sets have different cardinality, they cannot be equal: if C(A) != C(B) then there are three possible
cases will happen: A is subset of B or B is subset of A or A and B is not related (none of them is subset of the other)
For case 1: A is subset of B and C(A) != C(B) => C(A) < C(B) => they are not equal. Same reasoning goes for case 2.
For case 3: It's obvious that they are not equal
